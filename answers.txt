Stage 0:
-------
1.a
	A task is enqueued when it is submitted with the submit_task function.
1.b
	It is dequeued when the task_waitall function is called,
	that is either at the end of the runtime or when the runtime executes
	a set of tasks (in the body of the task_waitall function).

2.
INIT 	-> 	at the initialization / creation
READY 	-> 	when submitted or if dependecies enabled, when child return from parents and we check if the parent is runnable,
		that is when all the children have terminated
RUNNING ->	when the task is being executed
TERMINATED ->   when terminate_task is called, purely to indicate that the task is terminated

Stage 1:
-------

1. The thread pool is created at the initialization of the runtime.
2. It checks for a ready task to be executed, dequeue it from the task_queue, executes it and return a value, then goes back to checking
   if there are ready tasks waiting to be executed.
3. Producer / Consumer
4. If the queue gets full we should first execute one of the task in it, to allow another one to be put in its place.
5. When the task queue is empty.

Stage 2:
--------

1. The resizing of the queue is necessary when the task you want to add is a "child" task and the queue is full.
   Because the parent task need to wait for its children, we cannot pop it from the queue to add its children in
   its place. Therefore you need to make more room for the children tasks.
2. A task is in the WAITING state if its termination depends on its children. It needs to WAIT for its children
   to terminate before it can resume.
3. 4 Cases:
	- TASK_COMPLETED + w/out PARENT: terminates normally.
	- TASK_COMPLETED + w/ PARENT   : increment parent dependencies done counter & check if parent is runnable.
	- TASK_TO_BE_RESUMED 		   : put the task to wait
